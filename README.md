## Inspiration
Knight Run was inspired by classic 2D platformers like Mario Run, Subway Surfers, and Geometry Dash. We wanted to create a game that would be enjoyable for both casual and experienced gamers, with challenging levels that keep players engaged.
## What it does
In Knight Run, players take control of a brave knight who must run, jump, and dodge through levels filled with enemies, obstacles, and treasures. With three lives to spare, players must navigate through increasingly difficult levels that feature both static and moving platforms.

## How we built it

**We decided to utilize the following languages and technologies:**

_Frontend:_

- Unity game engine
- Unity Assets
- Adobe Photoshop
- C#

_Backend:_

- C#

_Other tools:_

- Visual Studio Code

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was creating moving platforms that kept the player in place. Additionally, posting the final game on Github and fixing errors in our code proved to be difficult tasks. However, through teamwork and perseverance, we were able to overcome these obstacles and create a fully functional game.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the work we put into Knight Run, including the implementation of animations and sounds for enemies, as well as the creation and animation of the UCF Knight character from scratch. We were also able to create a working menu and level select screen, providing players with a smooth and enjoyable user experience.
## What we learned
Through the development of Knight Run, we gained a better understanding of C# programming and the Unity game engine. We learned how to utilize Unity Game engine 2-D to its fullest potential, allowing us to create an engaging game for players.
## What's next for Knight Run
Moving forward, we plan to fix any remaining bugs and continue to add additional levels to the game. We are excited to see how players respond to Knight Run and look forward to the future of our project.
